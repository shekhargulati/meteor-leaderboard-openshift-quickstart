  "readme": "# Meteor\n\nMeteor is an ultra-simple environment for building modern web\napplications.\n\nWith Meteor you write apps:\n\n* in pure Javascript\n* that send data over the wire, rather than HTML\n* using your choice of popular open-source libraries\n\nDocumentation is available at http://docs.meteor.com/\n\n## Quick Start\n\nInstall Meteor:\n\n    curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh\n\nCreate a project:\n\n    meteor create try-meteor\n\nRun it:\n\n    cd try-meteor\n    meteor\n\nDeploy it to the world, for free:\n\n    meteor deploy try-meteor.meteor.com\n\n## Slow Start (for developers)\n\nIf you want to run on the bleeding edge, or help develop Meteor, you\ncan run Meteor directly from a git checkout.\n\n    git clone git://github.com/meteor/meteor.git\n    cd meteor\n\nIf you're the sort of person who likes to build everything from scratch,\nyou can build all the Meteor dependencies (node.js, npm, mongodb, etc)\nwith the provided script. If you do not run this script, Meteor will\nautomatically download pre-compiled binaries when you first run it.\n\n    # OPTIONAL\n    ./admin/generate-dev-bundle.sh\n\nNow you can run meteor directly from the checkout (if you did not\nbuild the dependency bundle above, this will take a few moments to\ndownload a pre-build version).\n\n    ./meteor --help\n\nOr install to ```/usr/local``` like the normal install process. This\nwill cause ```meteor``` to be in your ```PATH```.\n\n    ./install.sh\n    meteor --help\n    \nAfter installing, you can read the docs locally. The ```/docs``` directory is a meteor application, so simply change into the ```/docs``` directory and launch the app:\n\t\n\tcd docs/\n\tmeteor\n\nYou'll then be able to read the docs locally in your browser at ```http://localhost:3000/```\n\n## Developer Resources\n\nBuilding an application with Meteor?\n\n* Announcement list: sign up at http://www.meteor.com/\n* Ask a question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/meteor\n* Meteor help and discussion mailing list: https://groups.google.com/group/meteor-talk\n* IRC: ```#meteor``` on ```irc.freenode.net```\n\nInterested in contributing to Meteor?\n\n* Core framework design mailing list: https://groups.google.com/group/meteor-core\n* Contribution guidelines: https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki\n",
